# Swing-Helper
This tool has been designed for use in introductory level computer science courses that use java.  The general idea is that it can be built into a jar file and then imported, and used in a project.  Generally, a large problem in introductory courses is that students need to have a pretty firm understanding of objects to create games and animations.  This means that first year students will have a hard time creating anything really cool.  This tool is designed to take away the complexity of making a game for introductory level students.

## **How to contribute**
This code base can certainly be optimized, and more features can be added.  Feel free to make changes or improvements.  Please rebuild the jar file when you make changes, so any teachers or students that download the project have access to it.  Keep in mind that this project is intended for use by students, so please make sure it is easy and straight forward to use.
