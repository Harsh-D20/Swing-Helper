# Swing-Helper
This tool has been designed for use in introductory level computer science courses that use java.  The general idea is that it can be built into a jar file and then imported, and used in a project.  Generally, a large problem in introductory courses is that students need to have a pretty firm understanding of objects to create games and animations.  This means that first year students will have a hard time creating anything really cool.  This tool is designed to take away the complexity of making a game for introductory level students.
